# Exploring the optimal _k_

This repo currently holds the code for the blogpost ["Optimal “k” when there’s
no cluster? Pham vs Gap Part
I"](https://haroldpimentel.wordpress.com/2014/12/29/optimal-k-when-theres-no-cluster-gap-vs-pham-part-i/).

The code requires a few packages, including `data.table` and `dplyr`. This is
mostly because I was running on a machine with an older version of R and
I couldn't install `dplyr`. The plots were then made on a newer version of R.
